This repository contains four different folders with build files of my bachelor thesis project.

The folders' contents are as follows:

* AM: Adaptive Music, this contains the game version with an adaptive soundtrack. The soundtrack progresses with the game and a raising in bpm and volume is used to emphasize the availability of a game mechanic.
* M: Music, this contains the game version with a static soundtrack. This version was used as the experimental condition.
* NM: No Music, this contains the game version with no soundtrack. Only sound effects and environmental sounds are included. This version was used as the control condition.
* Tutorial: This contains the tutorial level, explaining controls, game mechanics and objectives.
